    ## Credits
    I had a tutoring session on 4/7 with Andrew Mason. He helped me with several items. I had the htmlroutes and apiroutes content in the server.js file. We split these out to simplify the server.js file. He really helped in teaching me to write one large Class in the store.js file that I could reference as methods in the apiroutes file to do things like readFile, add a note, write a note, delete a note, etc. He taught me the uuid method available to generate random IDs. He also taught me the read and write fs methods using util.
